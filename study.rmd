<p1>Independent study: Black-White within-school achievement gaps</p1>
<br>
In this independent study, my goal was to review some of the key explanations for within-school achievement gaps in the sociology of education literature. I am particularly interested in texts discussing how school contexts and school characteristics contribute to or mitigate the production of academic inequality within schools. My literature review focuses on four key themes: (1) peer networks, (2) student course taking, (3) teacher expectations and (4) parental influence.
