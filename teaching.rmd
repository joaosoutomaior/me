This introductory course is designed to prepare undergraduate &
master’s level students to use statistics for data analysis. This course covers descriptive and
inferential statistics; including frequency distributions, graphs, measures of central tendency,
measures of variability, sampling, probability, z-score, the normal distribution, and tests of
hypothesis such as t-tests, ANOVA, linear correlation and regression, and chi-squared analysis.
Effect size, study designs (observational and experimental) and research concepts (association
and causation; confounding and interaction) will also be addressed. The IBM-SPSS software will
be used for data analysis.

## Undergraduate seminars

<p4>
<p1>URS Seminar: Research, Creative Work and the Public Good --- University of Wisconsin-Madison</p1>
<br>
The course is designed to introduce students to the practice of research and creative work, and
its implications for society. The course has two components: the work you do as an assistant on
faculty projects, and your participation in the small group seminar. In the school year 2016-17, the
seminar is dedicated to the theme: research, creative work and the public good. We will spend
the year critically exploring this theme across different disciplines, and touching on a range of
societal problems. The theme is to provoke reflection in our research or creative work experiences, and in the
different parts of the world we inhabit. Come prepared to share your thinking on the topics
introduced. Through discussions, activities and assignments you may learn as much from one
another as you learn through your research project.
